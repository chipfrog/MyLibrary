If username and password are correct, user will be directed to the main page of the application.

## Searching and adding books
On the top right corner there is a search bar that is used for searching books from Google's database. To do a general search simply type something related to the book you're looking for (title, author, etc.) and click the blue search-button. You will be directed to a search results page where results are shown as clickable 
book covers. You can also do more specific searches. By clicking the "Filter by"-button you can choose to search by title or author field alone. To do a general search again, choose "No filter". Keywords can also be written inside quotation marks to search for exact word matches.

_Info card_

### Info cards

Added books are listed as info cards on the main page. They show basic information about the book but also have some limited interactivity. The bottom right corner shows your review score for the book as a five star system. By default the score is set to 1/5 but you can change it by clicking the stars. Every time you change the score the page sorts books again from the highest score to the lowest. On the bottom left corner two green icons (see _Info card_-picture) may be shown. The green book icon is shown if you have marked the book as "read". The green box icon is shown if you have marked the book as "owned". To learn how to mark book as "read" and "owned" read further. The book cover thumbnail on the info card works as a link to the book's info page where you can read and edit more information about the book.
