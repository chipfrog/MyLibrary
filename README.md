# MyLibrary

Work in progress...

Program made for University of Helsinki's Full Stack web developement course. 

It allows user to search for books using Google Books API and save them in a database.
Books can be saved in different categories such as 'read', 'to-be-read', 'wishlist' etc. User can write reviews, save favourite quotes and add comments about read books. Books can also be filtered by various criteria such as rating, genre, author and year.
